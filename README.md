# sta141b_final_project

This project is intended for checking the status of Covid-19 in different countries.

The left panel is for input. You could select the country or countries you want to check in a certain time period. The three status you can check during the time period is confirmed, deaths, and recovered.

The right panel is for output. You could view the global Covid-19 summary. A status plot is also avaliable for the country or countries you have chosen during a certain time period. The darkblue line is for Country 1, and the red line is for Country 2.

You can also check the table for the country or countries you are interested. Statistics during the time period will be shown below the plot. Both general statistics and specific statistics during the time period are included. You can also compare the statistics between the two countries you have chosen.
