# STA 141B Final Project: Covid-19 Status Tracker

## Notice: Data Retrieval Issues
Unfortunately, the api.covid19api.com is no longer working, resulting in the inability to retrieve data for this dashboard.

## Introduction
This project aims to provide a comprehensive Covid-19 status overview for different countries.

The left panel allows you to select one or multiple countries and specify a time period for analysis. During this period, you can track three key status indicators: confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.

The right panel displays the global Covid-19 summary. Additionally, a status plot is available for the selected country or countries during the specified time period. The dark blue line represents Country 1, while the red line represents Country 2.

You can also refer to the table below the plot to explore specific Covid-19 statistics for the countries you are interested in. It provides both general statistics and specific figures for the selected time period. Furthermore, you have the option to compare the statistics between the two chosen countries.

Please note that the API being used for data retrieval is not entirely stable. Therefore, occasionally refreshing the website may be necessary to ensure smooth functionality.
